# Contributing

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Trial Python.
These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it are governed by a [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How to contribute to Trial Python

To start to develop within this project open up the NOTES.md and note down what you're going to work on during the pompodoro. Follow the instructions below on starting the tests in watch mode. Follow the TDD rules of writing a failing test, then writing just enough code to get it to pass, and commit. If you can clarify the code without changing the functionality then refactor, keeping the tests passing.

### Test Driven Development

To get 100% test coverage we do test-driven development.

#### Unit tests

To start unit test-driven development run:

```bash
pipenv run watchTestUnit
```
